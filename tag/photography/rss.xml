The location is
perfect for stargazing. The vastness of the desert contributes to the vastness
of space and creates a unique atmosphere ideally suited for marveling at the
night sky.</p>
<p>I have been fascinated by space for as long as I can remember and have wanted to
take a picture of the Milky Way core for years. I have made <a href="https://mikhalevi.ch/the-sky-above-the-woods-was-the-color-purple/">attempts</a> in the
past, but none of them were as good as the pictures I took last weekend.
Nevertheless, I have many more astrophotography ideas and am already looking
forward to my next night sky photoshoot.</p>
